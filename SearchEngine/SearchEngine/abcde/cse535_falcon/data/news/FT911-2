 Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article. Geevor, the UK mining group which has been fighting for survival since the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce called in a Pounds 2.1m loan in extraordinary circumstances in January, has suffered another set-back. Its proposed merger with European Mining Finance, a Luxembourg-quoted investment company, has run into problems and will not go ahead on the terms announced in March. Two of the pre-conditions for the merger have not been satisfied - the raising of bank finance for the enlarged group and the termination of the management agreement between EMF and its manager, Lion Mining Finance. However, Geevor said it remained in talks with EMF and other parties 'which may result in modified proposals'. Monarch Resources, the UK-quoted mining group with operations in Venezuela, has appointed Mr Anthony Ciali as president and chief executive officer. This follows the recent boardroom shake-up which resulted in the departure of seven directors and the arrival of Mr Michael Beckett as chairman. Mr Beckett was managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields and Mr Ciali was once a vice-president of Gold Fields Mining Corp, a US subsidiary. Correction (published 16th May 1991). Lion Mining Finance is not the manager of European Mining Finance as we reported on May 14.
